              4Grow respects the privacy of our users ("user" or "you"). This Privacy Policy applies to 4Grow’s games, apps, websites and related services (together the "Services" or individually as "games", "apps", "websites"), and explains how we and affiliated companies ("4Grow", "we", "us", "our") collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our services.

            <h2>Important Privacy Information</h2>
            <p>
              To use the service on the Website, we may ask you to enter information about your age, gender, email address, name, current financial situation and ask other onboarding questions. We also automatically collect from your device: language settings, IP address, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system. We need this data to provide our services, analyze how our customers use the service and to measure ads.
            </p>
            <p>
              For improving our service and serving ads, we use third party solutions. As a result, we may process data using solutions developed by Amazon Web Services, Meta, Google, TikTok, Hotjar, Amplitude, Apple, PayPal, FreshDesk, Solidgate, ActiveCampaign. Therefore, some of the data is stored and processed on servers of such third parties. This enables us to: (1) analyze different interactions (how often users make subscriptions, what is the most popular users’ financial goal, what is the average time spent by users on the service); (2) serve ads (and are able to show them only to a particular group users, for example, to subscribers). Consequently, we, in particular, better understand in what of our features and content you see the most value and are able to focus on them to enhance your experience and increase the quality of our products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read our Privacy Policy below to know more about what we do with data (Section 3), what data privacy rights are available to you (Section 6) and who will be the data controller (Section 1). Depending on the region from where you access our Services and the choice of our product, we strive to provide you with various privacy control features and rights. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Influence online tracking via e-Privacy settings in our websites.</li>
              <li>Opt-out from sale/share of data (in the meaning of certain US laws).</li>
              <li>Request data and account deletion.</li>
              <li>Exercise other privacy rights.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When such features are available to you, this will be prominently displayed either in footers, menus, or profile sections of our products. We aim to provide most of these rights as privacy features that may be accessed by you on your own by simple UX/UI friendly interactions with our service (when you struggle to find them or they are not available as a feature, please submit a request to us). If any questions remain unanswered, please contact us through <a href="mailto:support@studevo.com">support@studevo.com</a>.
