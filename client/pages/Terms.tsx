17. Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND—THIS SECTION CONTROLS HOW DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY WILL BE ADDRESSED.
BY AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
YOU ARE ALSO AGREEING TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION UNLESS YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO REJECT ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW.
You and Сoursiv (“we” or the “Company”) agree to resolve all Disputes (including any related disputes involving the Company, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates) through binding arbitration, as described below, except for: (i) claims that fall within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, provided such claims are not class action disputes and also meet the court’s jurisdictional and monetary limits; and (ii) disputes related to intellectual property rights. A “Dispute” means any claim, controversy, or legal action—whether arising from past, present, or future events, and based on contract, tort, statute, or common law—between you and the Company regarding the Website, Services, or this agreement (the “Arbitration Agreement”). “Dispute” also includes disputes about the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including whether any part of it is invalid or unenforceable.
Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice Procedure
You and we agree that good faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often result in a faster, inexpensive outcome. Therefore, if you intend to assert a claim for any Dispute (as defined above) against the Company, you must first send the Company a written notice of the Dispute (“Notice”) that gives the Company some basic information about you and the Dispute. Any Notice must include (i) your name, address, and email address, (ii) a detailed description of your Dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding your use of the Website and Service (including your account ID, profile screenshots, and anything else that will help us identify your account; (iv) a detailed description of the relief you are seeking, including a calculation of any money damages you are seeking; and (v) a personally signed statement from you (and not your attorney) verifying the accuracy of the information in Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute. If you are filling out a Notice for another person, you must include all information described above, and also a statement describing your relationship to the person and why the person is unable to fill out the Notice for themselves.
If we need to send you a Notice, we will send the Notice to you at the contact information we have available for you, which may include, if applicable, the contact information associated with your account.
After we receive a Notice, you and us agree to engage in good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute between us for a period of 60 days through informal negotiation. The 60-day period can be extended if you and we agree that such an extension is likely to lead to resolution. As part of the informal negotiation process, you and we agree that we will both attend at least one individualized video conference (”Video Conference”). The Video Conference can be via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, or any other similar platform that you and we agree on and that we both have access to. The Video Conference can be held after the 60-day period, if necessary. If you are represented by an attorney in your Dispute, your attorney may participate in the Video Conference, but you are still required to attend and participate in good faith. The Company is also required to participate in the Video Conference by sending one or more of its representatives, and the Company may also send one or more of its attorneys. If you are unable to participate in the Video Conference by video, you may attend telephonically if you certify in writing that circumstances exist that prevent you from appearing by video (such as your lack of access to phone with a working camera or your inability to connect to a stable internet connection). You and we agree that we (and our attorneys, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the Video Conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time after we receive a Notice. You and we also agree to use our best efforts to resolve the Dispute at the Video Conference. If you and we cannot resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding.
Compliance with these Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures is Mandatory and Pre-Filing Notice procedures (including the Video Conference requirement) are a condition precedent to initiating any arbitration or small claims court action. Failure to follow the procedures is a breach of this Arbitration Agreement.
The Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice procedures are essential so that you and the Company have a meaningful opportunity to resolve Disputes in an inexpensive and efficient manner. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration unless the party bringing the demand for arbitration certifies in writing that the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice procedures (including the Video Conference requirement) were fully satisfied. If the party bringing the demand for arbitration fails to include a written certification that the Pre-Filing Notice procedures (including the Video Conference) were met, then the arbitration forum shall administratively close the demand for arbitration and no fees shall be due from the responding party. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action accordingly.
All offers, promises, conduct, and statements made in the course of the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice process by any party, its agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential and not admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding (except as required to certify in writing that the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice procedures were completed before submitting a demand for arbitration). Evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable by this section.
Small Claims Court
Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements and Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice requirements explained above, you or the Company may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small claims court rather than through arbitration, so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis. If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the arbitral forum that it chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court. At that time, the arbitral forum will administratively close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the arbitration respondent.
What is Arbitration?
Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award some of the same individualized damages and relief that a court can award. An arbitrator cannot, however, order a party to act or stop doing something—this is known as “equitable relief.” Either you or we can go to court and seek equitable relief, including by filing a motion to compel the other party to follow this Arbitration Agreement. However, you and we agree that the only courts where we will seek equitable relief are the state and federal courts in Delaware. This exception for equitable relief does not waive this Arbitration Agreement. You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. A court of competent jurisdiction has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these terms and the termination of your account.
CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT DESCRIBED ABOVE). YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE OTHER, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE LITIGATED IN COURT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS.
EXCEPT FOR THE MASS FILING PROCEDURES DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT
	THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM.
	THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.
IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE FOR A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF, AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE AFFIRMED AND SUCH DECISION BECOMES FINAL, THEN YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.
Arbitration Procedure
The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (“NAM Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice address listed above. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration with NAM at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-3.21.2024.pdf or by contacting NAM.
If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §5.
You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a written certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Filing Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements enclosed with any demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their attorney, if represented).
The arbitration will be in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed remotely pursuant to the NAM Rules, as modified herein. You and the Company agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties or the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary.; and (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in either Delaware, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the NAM Rules.
The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of Florida in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings.
The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this Arbitration Agreement. In the event NAM Rules conflict with this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of this Arbitration Agreement would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration, then the Arbitrator shall have the authority to modify such term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with  efficient and inexpensive resolution of Disputes.
Unless you and Сompany otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted virtually via video or teleconference.
Decision of the Arbitrator
Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue their decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.
The arbitration award is binding only between you and the Company and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party.
Fees
The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith.
You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees.
Confidentiality
Upon either your or our request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.
Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment
At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or the Company may serve a written offer of judgment upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer (which, solely for purposes of offers of judgment, may include reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent they are recoverable by statute, in an amount not to exceed the damages awarded).
The parties agree that any disputes with respect to settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment in a Mass Filing are to be resolved by a single arbitrator to the extent such offers contain the same material terms. For arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties’ attorneys agree to communicate individual settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers are extended.
Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration Filings
The following provisions set forth additional procedures that apply to mass arbitration filings. If ten (10) or more similar claims are asserted against the Company by the same or coordinated attorneys or are otherwise coordinated, consistent with the definition and criteria of “Mass Filings” set forth in the NAM Rules, you and we understand and agree that these additional procedures shall apply and the resolution of your dispute might be delayed. You and we agree that throughout this process, our attorneys shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. You and we agree to make all reasonable efforts to maximize the integrity and efficiency of arbitration to resolve Disputes between us, particularly those involving Mass Filings, and further commit to acting in good faith to adhere to the procedures established in this section. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of claims.
Bellwether Arbitrations for Mass Filings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated as the “Initial Test Cases,” to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration in a Mass Filing, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands) will be held in abeyance, and neither you nor the Company will be required to pay any such filing fees. You and the Company also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of this Arbitration Agreement for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.
Global Mediation in Mass Filings. Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to resolve the outstanding cases. If the Parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Global Mediation, the Parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court with the remaining claims. Notice of the opt-out shall be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Global Mediation. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations may then be filed and administered by the arbitration provider. You and we also acknowledge that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled pending resolution of the global mediation process.
Severability. If any part of this Mass Arbitration provision is declared invalid, void, or unenforceable, then that provision is severable from the Arbitration Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
