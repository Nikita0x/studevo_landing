            <h2>4. What We Offer</h2>
            <p>
              Studevo provides a range of educational materials, including articles, reading materials, and test questions. We also offer an AI Chat feature for educational purposes. All the materials and services are collectively referred to as “Digital Content”. Please read carefully the disclaimers and warranties below with regards to this Digital Content.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will have access to the Digital Content and our product Studevo only after registering for the Service, which means you will have to register and pay for the introductory offer (trial) or subscription plan (4 weeks, 12 weeks or otherwise) depending on what you select at the time of purchase. After the purchase and while using the Service you may be offered additional paid features. Please read carefully any offers you receive from us.
            </p>

            <h2>5. AI Chat mentor</h2>
            <p>
              While using our Service you will also have access to the Mentor chat powered by Artificial Intelligence ("AI Chat"). AI Chat is implemented for educational purposes only and is not intended to provide financial advice.
            </p>
            <h3>How is your Content regulated while using AI Chat?</h3>
            <p>
              While using our AI Chat, you may provide your information ("Input"), and we'll generate responses based on your Input ("Output"). You own your Input and we assign you all the rights permitted by law on the Output (collectively “Content”). However, we may use such Content to improve our services, but you can opt out of this if you contact us.
            </p>
            <h3>An important note with regards to the nature of AI Content</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Services may generate the same or similar output for Studevo or a third party. For example, you may provide input to a model such as “How many days in January?” and receive output such as “There are 31 days in January.” Other users may also ask similar questions and receive the same response. Responses that are requested by and generated for other users are not considered your Content.

            <p>

BY AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. YOU ARE ALSO AGREEING TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION UNLESS YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO REJECT ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and Сoursiv (“we” or the “Company”) agree to resolve all Disputes (including any related disputes involving the Company, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates) through binding arbitration, as described below, except for: (i) claims that fall within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, provided such claims are not class action disputes and also meet the court’s jurisdictional and monetary limits; and (ii) disputes related to intellectual property rights.

Therefore, if you intend to assert a claim for any Dispute against the Company, you must first send the Company a written notice of the Dispute (“Notice”) with your contact details, a detailed description of the Dispute and relief sought, verification by personal signature, and it must be individualized. After we receive a Notice, both parties agree to good-faith efforts for 60 days, including at least one individualized video conference. Compliance with these procedures is mandatory and a condition precedent to initiating any arbitration or small claims action.
            </p>
            <h3>Small Claims Court</h3>
            <p>
              Subject to jurisdictional requirements and Pre-Filing Notice, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in small claims court so long as it proceeds only on an individual basis. If arbitration was already demanded, the other party may elect small claims, and the arbitration provider will close the demand.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Arbitration?</h3>
            <p>
              Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve disagreements than litigation. Arbitrators can award individualized damages and relief; equitable relief may be sought in court only in Delaware. The U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs interpretation and enforcement. This provision survives termination.
            </p>
            <h3>Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
            <p>
              TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO LITIGATE IN COURT IN FAVOR OF ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS). THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR CLAIMS TO BE LITIGATED IN COURT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS. If any prohibition is found unenforceable for a particular claim, that claim may proceed in court, stayed pending individual arbitration of remaining claims.
            </p>
            <h3>Arbitration Procedure</h3>
            <p>
              The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”) under applicable NAM Rules as modified herein. The demand must certify completion of the Mandatory Pre-Filing procedures and be personally signed. A single independent arbitrator will be appointed; proceedings are conducted online/by writings unless otherwise agreed/required. Venue and governing law follow NAM Rules and Florida law; the FAA governs. The Arbitrator shall adhere to this Agreement; conflicts with NAM Rules are controlled by this Agreement.
            </p>
            <h3>Decision, Fees, Confidentiality, Settlement Offers</h3>
            <p>
              Barring extraordinary circumstances, a written, reasoned award issues within 120 days of appointment. Fees are governed by NAM Rules; to the extent fees are prohibitive, we will pay amounts deemed necessary unless claims are frivolous or in bad faith. The Arbitrator may order confidentiality. Offers of judgment procedures similar to civil rules may apply.
            </p>
            <h3>Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration Filings</h3>
            <p>
              For Mass Filings (10+ similar claims), bellwether arbitrations will proceed first (five per side), others held in abeyance with filing fees deferred. Following bellwethers, the parties will attempt Global Mediation; absent resolution, parties may opt out to court. Statutes of limitation are tolled during this process. Severability applies to this section.
            </p>
            <h3>Opting Out of Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              Existing users may reject the updated Arbitration Agreement as described; otherwise bound. New users after August 30, 2025 may opt out within 30 days by emailing support@studevo.com with required identification details and an unequivocal opt-out statement. Opting out leaves other terms intact. This Arbitration Agreement survives termination; severability applies.
            </p>
            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
              The laws of the State of Florida govern (excluding conflicts rules). To the extent any action is brought in court, exclusive jurisdiction is in Delaware courts. EEA/UK/Switzerland consumers retain mandatory protections and may bring disputes in their country of habitual residence; the Company shall do likewise.
